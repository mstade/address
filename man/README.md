# Address

## What is Address

Address is the [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) library for [resource oriented architecture (ROA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture).

It provides
 * an API for configuring and invoking requests for resources,
 * utilities for creating appropriate responses from resources,
 * utilities for displaying resources in the DOM.

## What are the benefits?

* Unify
  * Unify the resources from multiple developer teams.
  * Create a common way to navigate to and load resources.
  * Compose new resources from already existing ones.
* Extensible
  * The list of resources can be extended during runtime
  * You can define custom [middlewares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) for adding custom behavior to existing resources
* Open, based on standards
  * Address is based on open standards and built with open source software
  * Uses HTTP methods and content negotiation to decide which resource to load
  * Uses Universal Module Definition (UMD) for easy integration
* Lightweight
  * Address only has a few dependencies
  * Resources can be implemented with any framework
  * Resource definitions are small and easy to understand
